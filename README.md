# NewsReader
Ugly news reader demo app to re-up my Android chops. Fetches the latest top 20 US news articles from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)
via an IntentService, stores them in a SQLite database via [SquiDB](https://github.com/yahoo/squidb), and renders the list.

## Third party libraries
* [SquiDB](https://github.com/yahoo/squidb)
* [okhttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
